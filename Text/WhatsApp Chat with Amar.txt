18/10/19, 12:42 pm - egg: Ants are attracted to cum and I can prove it.

I sit down at my desk and open my porn folder. I scroll through all the weak nonsense such as hentai and loli until I get to my futa furry toddler nugget porn. I start jerking it and within two minutes I was covered in my own seed.

The speed at which I wanked made me incredibly tired so I laid down and went to sleep, hoping to dream of My Little Pony and their tight pussies.

I suddenly wake up and am very itchy. I look down in horror to see hundreds of little ants crawling over me, eating the sweet, sweet semen. The feeling of their little feet walking all over me was enough to make me bust again. This time, however, they noticed the source of the sweet nectar. They began forming lines and burrowing themselves into my foreskin. I arched my back and moaned loudly as they nibbled the head of my penis.

They began to go into my urethra and make little ant nests in the residue. I was thrashing on my bed because I wanted to nut again but I couldn't. My mom walks in to see this and she screams in horror. As soon as I turn my head to look, I busted the hottest, fattest nut I ever have. An explosion of ants rocket out of my penis and all over the floor.

My mom runs out in terror and I begin to finally clean up. Just the thought of what happened sent chills down my spine. I picked the few ants that were still alive and kept them in a jar. I couldn't wait to do it again.

This is your moment ClownDonkey. All those days you spent masturbating while your friends were out chasing girls and having sex. All those times you got called a wanker. All those suspensions for 'inappropriate behavior' you got in secondary school. This is when it all becomes worth it.

I lube up my hands and drop my trousers. The crowd falls silent.

Everything is going well. But then...

Childhood Flashback: I'm at my uncles wedding. Standing in the church with my pants down. There is cum on floor. My Father is screaming at me - 'Dammit ClownDonkey, you're never going to make it at masturbating, stop being such a wanker!'

Dammit ClownDonkey, you're never going to make it at masturbating, stop being such a wanker!

Dammit ClownDonkey, you're never going to make it at masturbating, stop being such a wanker!

Dammit ClownDonkey, you're never going to make it at masturbating, stop being such a wanker!

Echoes through my mind.

I've lost focus. I begin to climax. There's no way this will beat the Russian performance.

But then... Who's that in the crowd? It's my Father.

'I believe in you, son! I believe in you!' says my Father.

I take a deep breath. I've gone too far to climax now.

I fall to the ground in exhaustion. The crowd cheers. I have beaten the Russian performance and set a new World Record.

'That's my boy! That's my boy' says my Father.

I approach my Father and we embrace.

'All I ever wanted was to make you proud, Dad' I say.

'You did, son. You did. I love you.'

'I love you too, Dad'

9/11/19, 9:59 am - egg: Mr Krabs furiously grips his own raging cock before violenty jerking off. He climaxes, spraying a mixture of blood and cum all over his office. He falls onto his back foaming at the mouth as he spasms and twitches from the unbearable pleasure. Slowly it fades and is replaced with the awful sting of pain in his testicles similar to that of a hive of angry hornets repeatedly stabbing them. His face does not change. He just lays there with his mouth foaming - a blank, vacant expression on his face as he stares at the ceiling, both eyes a dull, milky white and his pupils like glass marbles. He cannot think. The drugs have completely racked his body and left him unable to form even the simplest of squeaks from his gaping mouth. As his vision blurs and his mind drifts, he sees a vision of God peering from the Heavens, stretching out a gentle and welcoming hand to Ugiene. Without a word, he extends his own claw out to meet God’s, and together they float off into the light. 

About 20 minutes after expected closing time, Spongebob enters Mr Krab’s office to check on him. His first instinct is to gasp as he sees the room soaked in impossible amounts of a sticky, reddish-white substance smelling of fetid crab meat. Tip-toeing through the room, he peeks around the corner of Krab’s desk and finds him dead on the floor, his bloodied cock and balls out and fully deflated as if they had been torn apart by a wild beast. Krabs has a smile on his face, a serene and peaceful grin that spread as Eugiene met his lord and savior, a single tear in his eye... and an empty syringe labeled “Ketamine” sitting beside him.

10/11/19, 8:12 pm - egg: I saw exactly 1.09441 square inches of a girl's shoulder today.
 I immediately fell to my knees, as the rush of dopamine signaling my impending earth-shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen everyone in the immediate vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or ever will produce, shot out so hard that my dick was ripped apart by my übernut accelerating to 5% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It vaporized the girl as it punched right through her, barely slowed, before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear-powered angle grinder. The sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused the school to collapse, and every female in the state of Illinois to fall pregnant with my children. When the final death toll was tallied, there were 146 deaths, 458 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies. As I lay dying under the rubble of my high school, I rest easy, knowing every one of my sons will repeat my glorious actions. Goodbye.

26/11/19, 8:59 am - egg: Why do people enjoy cock and ball torture? The act of intentionally or accidentally bringing pain upon the male genitals is typically a thought that people wince at with great force. However, there is a reason why this is an enjoyable experience. One rooted in the most important of sciences. Physics. Take, for example, a bottle of Tobasco Sauce. If one where to move the bottle up and down in a motion reminiscent to the one used during male self-stimulation it typically results in a moderate amount of sauce exiting the bottle. If struck hard on the bottom, however, a large amount will spurt out. Should this be done with the name genitals, turning them upside down and then striking the bottom of the scrotum with moderate to immense force, this will result in a large amount of seed to be ejected from the penis due to the energy being transferred from the palm of the hand to genitals. Therefore, because of physics and the transfer of energy from palm to the genitals, cock and ball torture is a scientifically pleasurable experience.

12/12/19, 11:21 am - Amar: So basically we're in school and we're having pe and for some reason we're playing like some game (i cant rmb) but there's a twist so if u want to play u need go sit at this like rectangle then the pe teacher will call u and then u play so obvsly we all play alot of time cos it was fun lah then we stop playing to take a break and this guy who looks like bach comes to me and says wtf why u nvr let me play then i was like bruh wtf u mean ur supposed to sit in the rectangle.   Then i point at the rectangle and i realised it was full of ppl alr and pe ending alr. So i just say next time dont waste time and queue so at this point of the story i asked arnd and ppl told me that the guy is alastair's brother but noone knew his name. So for some reason this guy got angry at me and he wanted to like punch me. That day we were having english exam or smth so we all had to gather smwhere and fr some reason the place we fathered at looked alot like my primary sch staff room so i was fast enuf to find a seat and i was last minute cramming and then the guy comes up to me and like he swings his hand i realise fast enough and manage to like totally stop him from hitting me then since i was cramming i didnt know wat to do with this guy so i asked a teacher and she say go inside the staff room and so i carried tgis random guy into the staff room and i saw the weirdest thing ever there are like 5 prison cages and one opposite where mr tay(pe hod) was sitting so i was making some noise cos like i was like why tf go prison cages and then he said like 'shhhh' put him inside and lock him and go and i did that then i left lmai

16/6/20, 9:23 pm - egg: ye they are
16/6/20, 9:23 pm - Amar: And tht brooding over this wont do me shit
16/6/20, 9:23 pm - egg: maybe nt brooding but

16/6/20, 9:24 pm - Amar: Other than maybe telling u guys how i feel earlier

16/6/20, 9:29 pm - Amar: I think we think vry differently
16/6/20, 9:29 pm - egg: there wasnt smt that made me feel like i needed to "compete"
16/6/20, 9:29 pm - egg: in some things yes
16/6/20, 9:29 pm - Amar: I dont think we needed to
16/6/20, 9:30 pm - Amar: But i think we had to tell each other
16/6/20, 9:30 pm - Amar: The baseline of our feelings
16/6/20, 9:30 pm - Amar: I had established my feelings on the very first day
16/6/20, 9:30 pm - Amar: But i think it got weaker and weaker
16/6/20, 9:30 pm - Amar: But urs was the other way
16/6/20, 9:31 pm - egg: my initial feelings were of

16/6/20, 9:32 pm - Amar: Its very selfish
16/6/20, 9:32 pm - Amar: But only i know what it is to feel tht way
16/6/20, 9:33 pm - Amar: I mean no shade to what ur trying to do
16/6/20, 9:33 pm - Amar: Its amazing
16/6/20, 9:33 pm - Amar: But i cant see myself there

16/6/20, 9:40 pm - Amar: Technically justin is still more successful than i am even tho he failed
16/6/20, 9:40 pm - egg: his replies to her r controlling and he doesnt give her space
16/6/20, 9:40 pm - egg: he demands her to be online
16/6/20, 9:40 pm - Amar: This one idk la
16/6/20, 9:40 pm - egg: to reply
16/6/20, 9:40 pm - Amar: I feel i do tht sometimes
16/6/20, 9:40 pm - egg: and to even accept his compliment

16/6/20, 9:43 pm - egg: he didnt stop
16/6/20, 9:43 pm - egg: when there were clear red flags
16/6/20, 9:43 pm - egg: maybe just maybe

16/6/20, 9:46 pm - egg: the rs was bull
16/6/20, 9:46 pm - Amar: Oh
16/6/20, 9:46 pm - Amar: Ye that makes more sense
16/6/20, 9:46 pm - egg: last time

16/6/20, 9:48 pm - egg: then who were u close to
16/6/20, 9:48 pm - Amar: He cld have taken a slower approach
16/6/20, 9:48 pm - Amar: And tried to understand her

16/6/20, 9:57 pm - Amar: And its definitely not ur fault
16/6/20, 9:57 pm - Amar: Other than maybe flexing on ur close friends
16/6/20, 9:57 pm - egg: well
16/6/20, 9:57 pm - Amar: But even tht is justified
16/6/20, 9:57 pm - Amar: Its ur close friends
16/6/20, 9:57 pm - egg: yesyes
16/6/20, 9:58 pm - Amar: So i did whst i found most appropriate

16/6/20, 9:59 pm - Amar: But she kinda posted semi regularly
16/6/20, 9:59 pm - Amar: So i muted tht
16/6/20, 9:59 pm - Amar: And low and behold it helped
16/6/20, 9:59 pm - Amar: Somewhat
16/6/20, 9:59 pm - egg: ppl act on emotions so even that semi regular shit will be enuf to justify ur momentary spark of jealousy and muting
16/6/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: Ye
16/6/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: I mean at tht point
16/6/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: I was just tryna block u guys as much as possible frm my life
16/6/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: But tht didnt rlly work out
16/6/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: Cos of my personality
16/6/20, 10:01 pm - egg: what abt it tho?
16/6/20, 10:01 pm - Amar: I dont rlly try to hold grudges
16/6/20, 10:01 pm - Amar: Or i try to fix them momentarily
16/6/20, 10:02 pm - Amar: Like Aiyah he's my friend at the end of the dsy

17/7/20, 11:48 pm - egg: then ik they will

17/7/20, 11:50 pm - Amar: And some stay
17/7/20, 11:51 pm - Amar: But i think of it as
17/7/20, 11:51 pm - Amar: Widening ur opportunitu
17/7/20, 11:51 pm - Amar: To find ppl who will stick
17/7/20, 11:51 pm - Amar: Idk man
17/7/20, 11:52 pm - egg: but to me
17/7/20, 11:52 pm - egg: i value unexpected friends more
17/7/20, 11:52 pm - egg: it makes more sense
17/7/20, 11:52 pm - Amar: I mean ye it does
17/7/20, 11:53 pm - egg: your idea of being friends is more likely a way fir you to find a way to experience a true friend
17/7/20, 11:53 pm - egg: but
17/7/20, 11:53 pm - egg: the experience of true friends will come unexpectedly
17/7/20, 11:53 pm - Amar: So far in my life
17/7/20, 11:53 pm - Amar: Ive been going with unexpected friends
17/7/20, 11:53 pm - Amar: And its been ok not great

17/7/20, 11:56 pm - egg: and noone rlly knows y also
17/7/20, 11:56 pm - egg: but my 2¢ again
17/7/20, 11:57 pm - egg: when we view ppl coming in and going,
17/7/20, 11:57 pm - Amar: I think its rlly the thing abt true friends
17/7/20, 11:57 pm - egg: if youre spending more energy to get them in than they give to u in the friendship
17/7/20, 11:57 pm - egg: is thr rlly smt
17/7/20, 11:57 pm - egg: that u can enjoy
17/7/20, 11:58 pm - Amar: I see a true friend in her although i dont even know jere
17/7/20, 11:58 pm - Amar: Now im intriguef
17/7/20, 11:58 pm - Amar: To what will happen
17/7/20, 11:58 pm - egg: hold those thoughts
17/7/20, 11:58 pm - egg: but save them for when someone appears in your life
17/7/20, 11:59 pm - egg: maybe u do all this and expect sum pleasant ending uk
17/7/20, 11:59 pm - Amar: Tbh this is evryone at one pt fr me
17/7/20, 11:59 pm - egg: like all the hard work
17/7/20, 11:59 pm - egg: but its also gnna exhaust u to go thru all that effort to smt that udk will ever happen

18/7/20, 12:00 am - Amar: Dont worry i oso dont see any future in this
18/7/20, 12:00 am - Amar: But i still hope that it will be possible
18/7/20, 12:01 am - egg: itll be if life wants it to happen
18/7/20, 12:01 am - egg: u can control it too
18/7/20, 12:01 am - Amar: I mean frm what ive experienced so far

18/7/20, 12:03 am - Amar: When im nowhere close

18/7/20, 12:03 am - egg: u got to look at it
18/7/20, 12:03 am - egg: as it is
18/7/20, 12:03 am - egg: if she dgaf
18/7/20, 12:03 am - egg: then rlly whats the pt

18/7/20, 12:04 am - Amar: But u can feel ig
18/7/20, 12:04 am - Amar: It was vry one sided with occasional like outbursts
18/7/20, 12:04 am - Amar: Of her talking more maybe cos thr topic was less boring
18/7/20, 12:05 am - egg: ye thats the thing
18/7/20, 12:05 am - egg: u see
18/7/20, 12:05 am - egg: one sided friendships will exhaust you

18/7/20, 12:05 am - egg: uve tried so much
18/7/20, 12:05 am - Amar: Momentarily

18/7/20, 11:36 pm - Amar: I mean we go by differing philosophies
18/7/20, 11:36 pm - Amar: And u go by what u think is rgt
18/7/20, 11:36 pm - egg: so whos wrong
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - Amar: I have definitely doubted my wats
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - Amar: It rlly doesnt matter
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - Amar: As long as ur happy
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - Amar: Im nt happy
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - Amar: But im nt willing to quit either
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - egg: the idea of contentment is still smt that u struggle with
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - egg: imo
18/7/20, 11:37 pm - Amar: Ye
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - egg: but its
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - Amar: Idk what it means to be contented
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - egg: smt that is often picked up more than learnt
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - Amar: All my life ive been trying to make ppl happy
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - egg: there are times where itll happen
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - Amar: But ive never thought what actlly makes me happy
18/7/20, 11:38 pm - Amar: And its these small friendships
18/7/20, 11:39 pm - Amar: Thats why the moment i like someone's personality
18/7/20, 11:39 pm - Amar: Its like i need to be friend's with them
18/7/20, 11:39 pm - Amar: U see i dont think ur wrong
18/7/20, 11:39 pm - Amar: Ur prob more right than me anyw
18/7/20, 11:39 pm - Amar: In terms of letting go
18/7/20, 11:40 pm - Amar: And maybe letting life decide and not hoping fr much
18/7/20, 11:40 pm - Amar: But this doesnt rlly work with my personality
18/7/20, 11:40 pm - Amar: And if i have to follow tht
18/7/20, 11:40 pm - Amar: Ill become a different person
18/7/20, 11:41 pm - egg: theres a diff between changing urself and becoming a diff person
18/7/20, 11:41 pm - egg: u can alw change the things that will make u feel shit
18/7/20, 11:41 pm - egg: but u cant change a personality
18/7/20, 11:41 pm - egg: but theres some things that need to be shaped better
18/7/20, 11:42 pm - egg: if happiness lies in other people then hell yeah its fine and pretty kewl ngl
18/7/20, 11:43 pm - egg: but its also the most shaky thing to ever handle
18/7/20, 11:43 pm - egg: its smt that can disappear
18/7/20, 11:43 pm - egg: its smt that is alm like rolling dice if u let life do it
18/7/20, 11:43 pm - egg: ofc reaching out to ppl will eventually make u friends
18/7/20, 11:43 pm - egg: if u dont then how would u meet them
18/7/20, 11:44 pm - egg: but what happens after
18/7/20, 11:44 pm - egg: isnt always clear cut
18/7/20, 11:44 pm - egg: if it works then itll be swee
18/7/20, 11:44 pm - Amar: Idk man
18/7/20, 11:44 pm - Amar: Ive never ever wanted to change
18/7/20, 11:44 pm - Amar: I tot things wld change instd
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - Amar: But now ik thats not how life works
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - egg: u cant change things in life
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - egg: but
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - Amar: I mean by no means is this a problem fr me
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - egg: u can change what u look at
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - Amar: Its more of a
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - Amar: Big thought
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - Amar: That i consistently think abt
18/7/20, 11:45 pm - egg: what else do u think abt
18/7/20, 11:46 pm - Amar: It doesnt rlly affect my life to what ppl see
18/7/20, 11:46 pm - egg: i believe
18/7/20, 11:46 pm - egg: that u hv to find urself first
18/7/20, 11:46 pm - egg: before friends
18/7/20, 11:47 pm - egg: but idk where u r at in this aspect
18/7/20, 11:47 pm - Amar: I mean ive alw seen myself as someone who cares more abt others
18/7/20, 11:47 pm - Amar: But to say tht sounds cocky
18/7/20, 11:47 pm - Amar: Which is why i dw to lose ppl
18/7/20, 11:47 pm - Amar: Cos i like them more than they like me
18/7/20, 11:48 pm - egg: if u care for urself, wont people come to u instead?
18/7/20, 11:48 pm - egg: or at least
18/7/20, 11:48 pm - Amar: How do i care for myself
18/7/20, 11:48 pm - Amar: How do i even know if smone is caring fr themself
18/7/20, 11:49 pm - egg: thats thru experience alr that is a big topic
18/7/20, 11:49 pm - Amar: Idk smone told me smth abt this bfr

18/7/20, 11:49 pm - Amar: Let evryth slide
18/7/20, 11:49 pm - Amar: Like if smone gets angry at u
18/7/20, 11:49 pm - Amar: If they wanna be ur friend they will get over it
18/7/20, 11:50 pm - Amar: I tried it fr awhile
18/7/20, 11:50 pm - Amar: It helped ig ye
18/7/20, 11:50 pm - Amar: But aft awhile i rlly didnt wanna do it
18/7/20, 11:50 pm - Amar: I mean i rather say sorry and get it over with
18/7/20, 11:50 pm - Amar: Then have smone be angry at me
18/7/20, 11:51 pm - Amar: Idk until i find a grp of ppl whom idh to wear a mask to
18/7/20, 11:51 pm - Amar: This will prob still go on

18/7/20, 11:54 pm - Amar: U cld do that eith any understanding stranger
18/7/20, 11:54 pm - egg: u aint that alone
18/7/20, 11:54 pm - egg: ppl also see thru all that
18/7/20, 11:55 pm - egg: they want a friendship that is more

18/7/20, 11:55 pm - Amar: Ok i can safely say the majority of ppl
18/7/20, 11:55 pm - egg: who are we to say that anyways
18/7/20, 11:55 pm - Amar: Have learnt to deal with this type of stuff and move on
18/7/20, 11:56 pm - Amar: Even you in some sense
18/7/20, 11:56 pm - egg: i can move on for sure

18/7/20, 11:56 pm - Amar: Its more of perspective
18/7/20, 11:56 pm - egg: i can take multiple perspectives at the same shit
18/7/20, 11:57 pm - Amar: I mean its either i join the grp of ppl who can move on
18/7/20, 11:57 pm - Amar: Or i find a way
18/7/20, 11:57 pm - egg: wdym
18/7/20, 11:57 pm - Amar: And i rlly wanna find s way
18/7/20, 11:57 pm - Amar: I think what you do is a variation of what ppl do unconsciously
18/7/20, 11:58 pm - Amar: Like uk tht ppl drift and its normal and tht if u have to hold on longer
18/7/20, 11:58 pm - Amar: Then ur rlly wasting ur time
18/7/20, 11:58 pm - Amar: And effort
18/7/20, 11:58 pm - egg: in my view

18/7/20, 11:58 pm - egg: i wont park my emotions into someone so easily

20/7/20, 9:37 am - egg: i think right

20/7/20, 9:49 am - Amar: A small step but still
20/7/20, 9:51 am - egg: ofc but still rmb its just a live and u can say pretty much anything
20/7/20, 9:52 am - egg: maybe she rmb some of the things u say but for the most part small talk wont last long in someones head
20/7/20, 9:54 am - Amar: Ye ik
20/7/20, 9:55 am - Amar: Dang ur rlly helping me in keeping my expectations fking low
20/7/20, 9:55 am - Amar: Last time i wld get happy at small things
20/7/20, 9:56 am - Amar: Like if she read my qn
20/7/20, 9:56 am - Amar: But now nth seens enough
20/7/20, 9:58 am - egg: tbh texting in a live _is pretty low_
20/7/20, 9:59 am - egg: but keep it low so when you do get closer thru smt else then youll feel alot btr
20/7/20, 9:59 am - egg: maybe she opens up another channel to communicate
20/7/20, 10:01 am - Amar: Ye
20/7/20, 10:02 am - Amar: That wld help big time
20/7/20, 10:02 am - Amar: If these lives stop she'll prob open up smth
20/7/20, 10:02 am - Amar: But all in all im rlly sad tht im not making any progress
20/7/20, 10:02 am - Amar: Like not even a bit
20/7/20, 10:04 am - egg: u aint really failing anything its just that maybe this aint the right person just yet
20/7/20, 10:04 am - Amar: I rlly hope she is
20/7/20, 10:05 am - Amar: And isn't at the same time
20/7/20, 10:05 am - egg: noone can hope for it thoo
20/7/20, 10:05 am - egg: its like telling life yo give u what u want
20/7/20, 10:05 am - egg: to
20/7/20, 10:05 am - Amar: If she is and i cant become her friend ill be sad af
20/7/20, 10:05 am - Amar: If she isnt then id still be sad
20/7/20, 10:05 am - Amar: But not as much
20/7/20, 10:05 am - egg: if you cant be her friend then is she really the one
20/7/20, 10:06 am - egg: would life play you liddat
20/7/20, 10:06 am - egg: u deserve to get someone to come yo you
20/7/20, 10:06 am - egg: if u find this

20/7/20, 10:08 am - Amar: Isnt that for her oso
20/7/20, 10:08 am - Amar: Doesnt she deserve someone to come to her
20/7/20, 10:08 am - Amar: Cant that be me
20/7/20, 10:08 am - egg: the thing is
20/7/20, 10:09 am - egg: its really gnna be unexpected
20/7/20, 10:09 am - egg: at least for the better ones
20/7/20, 10:10 am - egg: cuz if it is, then its not like the "i saw you and noe i want you so ill try hard" but more of "i met u in the luckiest of times and now i want to be with you" type
20/7/20, 10:10 am - egg: it can
20/7/20, 10:10 am - egg: but you can only try
20/7/20, 10:10 am - egg: you cant call yourself 'the one'
20/7/20, 10:11 am - egg: bcuz of the amt of effort u put in
20/7/20, 10:11 am - egg: girls r confusing ur efforts dont translate into results that easily
20/7/20, 10:11 am - egg: hard reality rlly
20/7/20, 10:12 am - egg: unless she also feels the same

21/7/20, 5:28 pm - Amar: but ive been broken too many times

21/7/20, 5:31 pm - egg: if its healthy to stop it then its your call
21/7/20, 5:31 pm - Amar: i mean it has been good so far
21/7/20, 5:32 pm - egg: i can tell u that she gives off a lot of false flags
21/7/20, 5:32 pm - egg: so thats y i can relate to u a little
21/7/20, 5:32 pm - egg: on how to spot ur feelings
21/7/20, 5:32 pm - egg: and tbh udh to immediately cut away

21/7/20, 5:32 pm - egg: its like finding smt u enjoy

21/7/20, 10:50 pm - Amar: I mean i dont think this is fully rgt
21/7/20, 10:50 pm - egg: then what do u think abt it?
21/7/20, 10:51 pm - Amar: I just thought ppl dc abt being friends with her as much as me
21/7/20, 10:51 pm - egg: and?
21/7/20, 10:51 pm - Amar: Not rlly tht im above them and tht i won attention

21/7/20, 10:54 pm - egg: say out wtv u thinking about
21/7/20, 10:54 pm - egg: and ill see what i can make of it
21/7/20, 10:54 pm - Amar: I mean i definitely didnt do tht to win out on attention
21/7/20, 10:54 pm - Amar: But i was just wondering whether ppl wanted to be her friend
21/7/20, 10:54 pm - Amar: Like me
21/7/20, 10:55 pm - Amar: But noone said it out
21/7/20, 10:55 pm - Amar: I agree

21/7/20, 10:57 pm - Amar: But dont u think i can think tht way
21/7/20, 10:57 pm - Amar: Just to make myself feel bttr
21/7/20, 10:58 pm - egg: first of all
21/7/20, 10:58 pm - egg: wtv im saying to u is for a bigger picture
21/7/20, 10:58 pm - egg: stuff like
21/7/20, 10:58 pm - egg: health in ur rs and fs
21/7/20, 10:59 pm - egg: thinking straight to avoid a madapa

21/7/20, 10:59 pm - egg: but if u get mentally torn down bcuz of her and the efforts u put in
21/7/20, 11:00 pm - egg: ppl r gnna look at what youve done and ur action, and start blaming u for causing ur own breakdown

22/7/20, 7:01 pm - Amar: Ye
22/7/20, 7:01 pm - egg: if we go for the same person

26/7/20, 9:58 pm - Amar: The thing is although i seem like i tell alot of ppl abt my problem more than actlly solving it
26/7/20, 9:58 pm - egg: we dont solve anything tbh
26/7/20, 9:58 pm - egg: just to clarify
26/7/20, 9:58 pm - egg: we do not aim to solve

26/7/20, 10:06 pm - egg: im sure they will be understanding
26/7/20, 10:06 pm - egg: primary school seems like an odd place to share emotions tho imho
26/7/20, 10:08 pm - egg: but mentally speaking its primary school and our ability to empathize is limited to what we believe its worth
26/7/20, 10:08 pm - egg: as we grow up we see that it is important and alot more people will realise the same
26/7/20, 10:08 pm - egg: dont give up hope i truly believe that there r people for u out there

9/9/20, 6:42 pm - Amar: Rlly shit
9/9/20, 6:42 pm - Amar: Cos she seems like she has nvr actlly been approached by a person to become friends
9/9/20, 6:42 pm - Amar: But im pretty sure ive done it before
9/9/20, 6:43 pm - egg: that could be smth new
9/9/20, 6:43 pm - egg: and potentially interesting

9/9/20, 6:44 pm - Amar: If ive learnt anyth
9/9/20, 6:44 pm - Amar: Being true to ur emotions and telling ppl how u feel

9/9/20, 6:46 pm - egg: you have a want to meet her then u finally do
9/9/20, 6:47 pm - egg: then it aint really that genuine
9/9/20, 6:47 pm - egg: in a sense

9/9/20, 6:47 pm - Amar: Ye true

9/9/20, 6:50 pm - Amar: Ye
9/9/20, 6:50 pm - egg: people being humans they wont turn out the way you might wanna
9/9/20, 6:50 pm - egg: lets say

9/9/20, 6:50 pm - egg: she has
9/9/20, 6:50 pm - egg: choices

9/9/20, 6:51 pm - egg: isnt permanent
9/9/20, 6:51 pm - egg: but
9/9/20, 6:51 pm - Amar: First impression is big w her

9/9/20, 6:51 pm - Amar: It blows the whole thing
9/9/20, 6:51 pm - egg: so in that case

9/9/20, 6:52 pm - Amar: Its nt worth anym
9/9/20, 6:53 pm - Amar: Tbh i shldnt even be trying
9/9/20, 6:53 pm - Amar: But issok its what has become of me
9/9/20, 6:53 pm - egg: but im just scared that

9/9/20, 6:53 pm - egg: like that aint it
9/9/20, 6:53 pm - Amar: Its likely to happen

9/9/20, 6:55 pm - egg: you can ofc change positively
9/9/20, 6:55 pm - egg: but when you remove some of the things u do
9/9/20, 6:55 pm - Amar: Like a wise man said

21/9/20, 9:55 pm - egg: ive adjusted to not toking to her
21/9/20, 9:55 pm - egg: and all that
21/9/20, 9:55 pm - Amar: But what happened tho?
21/9/20, 9:55 pm - egg: nth happened
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - egg: time just rotted away parts of it
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - egg: till eventually
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - Amar: So she hasnt talked
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - Amar: Since
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - Amar: ?
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - egg: ok i mean
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - egg: its been 9 mths
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - egg: since jan 1
21/9/20, 9:56 pm - egg: alm 10
21/9/20, 9:57 pm - egg: i wouldve wanted to take my time
21/9/20, 9:57 pm - egg: but with this age gap its impossible for me to not overthink
21/9/20, 9:57 pm - egg: cuz she in sch i grad
21/9/20, 9:57 pm - egg: then she has sec 3 and sec 4 to find others
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - egg: there wasnt a thing gg on btw us so that just makes my overthinkingness worse
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - Amar: So basically
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - Amar: U realised u dont rlly like her
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - egg: she is giving me a hard time to
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - Amar: True enuf
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - egg: and imo
21/9/20, 9:58 pm - egg: that shouldnt be a problem
21/9/20, 9:59 pm - egg: but when she says im special and decides to not do anything to even show it
21/9/20, 9:59 pm - egg: its strange and confusing
21/9/20, 9:59 pm - egg: even when we went out
21/9/20, 9:59 pm - egg: she was on her phone
21/9/20, 9:59 pm - Amar: I cant believe ur situation tbh
21/9/20, 9:59 pm - Amar: So close yet so far
21/9/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: Its closer than id ever gotten
21/9/20, 10:00 pm - Amar: But more complicated than it ever has been
21/9/20, 10:00 pm - egg: ik
21/9/20, 10:00 pm - egg: but shit is getting repetitive
21/9/20, 10:01 pm - egg: i tell her that im feeling shit bcuz of her inaction
21/9/20, 10:01 pm - egg: then a spark of reconciliation
21/9/20, 10:01 pm - egg: but then nothing changed
21/9/20, 10:01 pm - egg: then i overthink
21/9/20, 10:01 pm - egg: then back to step 1
21/9/20, 10:01 pm - Amar: At the end of the day
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - Amar: Shes sec 2
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - Amar: Its vry hard fr her to connect w you
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - Amar: No matter how mature she is
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - egg: how
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - Amar: Its the experience
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - egg: then when she said i was the closest person to her
21/9/20, 10:02 pm - egg: was that a lie
21/9/20, 10:03 pm - Amar: Its slightly true but not rlly
21/9/20, 10:03 pm - egg: but what ive realised
21/9/20, 10:03 pm - egg: in the end of the day i shouldnt chase ppl
21/9/20, 10:03 pm - egg: but its a lesson ive learnt thru this
21/9/20, 10:04 pm - egg: i needa let her go
21/9/20, 10:04 pm - egg: it wouldve been easy
21/9/20, 10:05 pm - egg: if it wasnt for the fact that she has said alot of things abt me then i wouldve had an easier time
21/9/20, 10:05 pm - egg: but now i see the value of words fsding away
21/9/20, 10:05 pm - egg: fading
21/9/20, 10:05 pm - egg: idk how she will move on tho
21/9/20, 10:05 pm - egg: thats the part im afraid of
21/9/20, 10:06 pm - Amar: She'll be fine
21/9/20, 10:06 pm - Amar: They all do
21/9/20, 10:07 pm - egg: all imma do is hope
21/9/20, 10:07 pm - egg: but now ill be fine
21/9/20, 10:07 pm - egg: as long as i keep myself in check
21/9/20, 10:07 pm - egg: but the decision to leave her alone from now on is concrete
21/9/20, 10:10 pm - Amar: Ye man
21/9/20, 10:11 pm - Amar: Tbh rn ive started to adapt to it
21/9/20, 10:12 pm - egg: to what
21/9/20, 10:16 pm - Amar: Letting life take its course
21/9/20, 10:17 pm - egg: for me its in terms of rs
21/9/20, 10:17 pm - egg: letting it come to you kinda thing
21/9/20, 10:17 pm - egg: we've had enough experience with chasing
